## Background

Innovation requires a carefully balanced combination of design inspiration, business acumen and engineering skill. We exist to focus the energy of multi-disciplinary teams to help innovators make an impact and reach their audience with amazing products.

We are designers, developers and managers. We are technologists, evangelists and skeptics. We are dreamers, thinkers, and doers. The synthesis of our backgrounds is a unique understanding of the constraints and challenges of product development and a set of field-tested approaches for building solutions.

We bring a wealth of experience in crafting digital and physical products and delivering them to market. From napkin sketches and whiteboard sessions to profitability and scaling we've done it all, and we'd love to work with you to help build your next big idea.

## Values

### Collaboration

Great products are made by teams with diverse skills and interests brought together to meet a common goal. At the heart of the process is open communication not only within the team, but also between a company and its potential users and stakeholders.

Whether with our clients, our users, or among ourselves, collaboration is at the heart of our product development. We strive to share our ideas and processes as openly as we can. We will give feedback earnestly and encourage our partners to do share theirs as well.

### Transparency

We believe that great products are born from an ongoing relationship between users and creators. In order to be successful, this process must be rooted in honesty and transparency.

We will always strive to share our ideas and processes as openly as we can. We will give feedback earnestly and encourage our partners to do share theirs as well. We will always take our partners' concerns seriously.

### Flexibility

We do not believe in one-size-fits-all solution; every project is unique in its constraints and challenges. While experience is a powerful teacher that informs our approach, we also recognize that solutions often lie beyond the limits of our current knowledge.

We approach every new problem with curiosity and adaptability. We innovate by exploring unfamiliar concepts, experimenting with emerging technology and investigating novel approaches to the challenges we face.

### Simplicity

Creep and bloat are the bane of product development. The more elaborate an approach, the more unintended consequences the team will face and the more difficult ongoing development will become. Unnecessary complexity often leads to unclear strategy, missed deadlines and low morale.

We believe simple solutions require creativity and a singular focus. We pursue simple solutions with a keen understanding of user needs, targeted strategic goals and a willingess to discard considerations outside of the core value proposition.
