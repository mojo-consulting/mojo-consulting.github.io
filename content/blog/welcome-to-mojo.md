## Motivation

As a team with decades of experience designing, building and deploying products we say with confidence: product development is hard. Innovation presents a daunting challenge to even the most seasoned veterans, let alone those just starting out. Successfully building a new product is a complex, messy process of harnessing a diverse set of disciplines to focus on a single objective.

Our purpose is to help everyone in the product development process excel by introducing fundamental insights, sharing powerful tools and offering top notch services for digital product development.

For more info about our values, background and experience, check out our (about page)[/about].


## Key Concepts

One of our primary aims is to explain key concepts of product development to a broad audience. We will share insights on a range of topics, from foundational definitions (what is product strategy?) to operational questions (how do we measure our net provider score?). We will strive to make our insights useful and actionable for any experience level or role.

In sharing this information we aim to empower everyone working to develop products. Whether you're a design student just starting out, a seasoned entrepreneur planning their next venture, or a software developer building your company's next offering, we are here to provide resources to meet the many challenges that you will face.

## Practical Tools

We believe that a concept is only useful insofar as it can be applied to a real problem. To this end, we will share tools that anyone can use to design a product strategy, generate innovative solutions, and execute a plan to get a new offering to the market.

We will focus on making powerful tools that are simple to use and adaptable to many different needs. The tools we share won't require any specific applications, or in most cases, any software at all. Instead, we will prioritize approaches that can be done on paper, a whiteboard, or any text editor.

## Our Services

In freely sharing our insights our goal is to give people the ammunition to achieve their product development challenges. We hope our tools and processes will help you and your team with all your projects large and small.

When more guidance is needed, our services are available for any stage of product development. Head to [services](/services) to learn more about what we can do for your company.
